# Soccer Career Generator LLM
### By Erik Huisman

## 1. Executive Summary
Many soccer fans, myself included, want to easily look at career retrospectives of some of the world's best players, but it is hard to find good summaries consistently outside of Wikipedia. So I have created a model that will generate a paragraph-long overview of a player's career, given that this player is manually inputted into the database. All you need to do is input the player's name into the terminal, and it will spit out a retrospective of its own. All of this can be achieved without using external databases like Wikipedia, so it also erases the risk of repetitive storytelling.
